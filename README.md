# terminalcalc

This application is a command-line "calculator" application that takes in a 
user-input arithmetic expression and outputs its value. It can be run from
the command line; simply compile with g++ or your preferred C++ compiler
(any C++ standard should work; I have tested it with g++ and
-std=gnu++98, -std=gnu++11, and -std=c++0x on my machine).
Then, run the resulting executable.

Instructions for formatting the input are printed when the program is run.

TODO: Add more comments, upload testcases, refactor code for readability and
maintainability.
